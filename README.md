### Transformers

> Most of transformers are done without frames so they might not work sometimes

---

> Deobfuscator only makes code readable for humans also if some decompilators can't decompile class try another and if
> no one works just create issue that
> includes: `[sample jar with obfuscation, deobfuscator transformers, deobfuscator log file]` and optional obfuscator name

---

> Built on: [Java 11 (Adoptium)](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11)
